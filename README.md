# Industrial Traffic Monitoring and Prediction System

A computer vision and machine learning-based system for monitoring, analyzing, and predicting traffic flow in industrial or urban environments. This project leverages deep learning (YOLOv8), real-time data analysis, and predictive modeling to provide actionable insights for traffic management and planning.

## 🚦 Features

- 📷 Real-time traffic monitoring 
- 🧠 Vehicle detection and counting using YOLOv8 models (n/s/m/x variants)
- 📈 Traffic flow prediction using trained machine learning models
- 💾 Storage of historical traffic data in local databases
- 📊 Visualization of traffic trends
- ⚠️ Congestion alerts or anomaly detection (optional/extendable)
